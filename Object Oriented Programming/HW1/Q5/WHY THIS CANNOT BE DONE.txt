The case where you get a fake triangle cannot be tested because the user is providing coordinate points into the program, instead of lengths.
Because of this, the triangle will always be possible.
It is similar to plotting three points on a cartesian plane and connecting the dots to form a triangle.
You will never not be able to do it unless you create a straight line, which this program does not test.
